## Create an Application class

The Spring Initializr creates a simple application class for you. However, in this case, it is too simple. You need to modify the application class to match the following listing (from `src/main/java/com/example/springboot/Application.java`):


First we will import the Arrays class in java, this class provides static methods to dynamically create and access Java arrays.
```editor:insert-lines-before-line
file: ~/spring-boot/src/main/java/com/example/springboot/Application.java
line: 3
text: |
      import java.util.Arrays;
```

Let's import a few more classes and explain them as we include in the Application.
```editor:insert-lines-before-line
file: ~/spring-boot/src/main/java/com/example/springboot/Application.java
line: 3
text: |
      import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
      import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
      import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;

```

Please focus on `@SpringBootApplication` for a moment as it provides significant value.
```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/spring-boot/src/main/java/com/example/springboot/Application.java
text: "@SpringBootApplication"
```

`@SpringBootApplication` is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following from the Spring Core framework:
*   `@Configuration`: Tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.
*   `@EnableAutoConfiguration`: Tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings. For example, if `spring-webmvc` is on the classpath, this annotation flags the application as a web application and activates key behaviors, such as setting up a `DispatcherServlet`.
*   `@ComponentScan`: Tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the `com/example` package, letting it find the controllers.

The `main()` method uses Spring Bootâ€™s `SpringApplication.run()` method to launch an application. 
```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/spring-boot/src/main/java/com/example/springboot/Application.java
text: "SpringApplication.run()"
```

Add the `CommandLineRunner` method to complete this class
```editor:insert-lines-before-line
file: ~/spring-boot/src/main/java/com/example/springboot/Application.java
line: 16
text: |
        @Bean
        public CommandLineRunner commandLineRunner(ApplicationContext ctx) {
            return args -> {

                System.out.println("Let's inspect the beans provided by Spring Boot:");

                String[] beanNames = ctx.getBeanDefinitionNames();
                Arrays.sort(beanNames);
                for (String beanName : beanNames) {
                    System.out.println(beanName);
                }

            };
        }
```

Did you notice that there was not a single line of XML? There is no `web.xml` file, either. This web application is 100% pure Java and you did not have to deal with configuring any plumbing or infrastructure.

There is also a `CommandLineRunner` method marked as a `@Bean`, and this runs on start up. 
```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/spring-boot/src/main/java/com/example/springboot/Application.java
text: "@Bean"
```
It retrieves all the beans that were created by your application or that were automatically added by Spring Boot. It sorts them and prints them out.

When you click into the next set of instructions called *7: Run the Application* after running your application you'll see `Let's inspect the beans provided by Spring Boot:` in your terminal followed by the all your beans being printed out.
```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/spring-boot/src/main/java/com/example/springboot/Application.java
text: "Let's inspect the beans provided by Spring Boot:"
```
In Spring, beans are the objects that are the foundation of your application and managed by IoC (Inversion of Control) also called Dependency Injection (DI). This allows the dependencies to be external from your application following cloud-native principles. In essence in Spring all objects are beans and it is essential you define your objects as beans to fully use Spring.
