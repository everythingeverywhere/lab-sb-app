## Create an Application class

The Spring Initializr creates a simple application class for you. However, in this case, it is too simple. You need to modify the application class to match the following listing (from `src/main/java/com/example/springboot/Application.java`):


```editor:insert-lines-before-line
file: ~/spring-boot/src/main/java/com/example/springboot/Application.java
line: 3
text: |
      import java.util.Arrays;
      
```


```
    @Bean
    public CommandLineRunner commandLineRunner(ApplicationContext ctx) {
        return args -> {

            System.out.println("Let's inspect the beans provided by Spring Boot:");

            String[] beanNames = ctx.getBeanDefinitionNames();
            Arrays.sort(beanNames);
            for (String beanName : beanNames) {
                System.out.println(beanName);
            }

        };
```


```editor:append-lines-to-file
file: ~/spring-boot/src/main/java/com/example/springboot/Application.java
text: |
        package com.example.springboot;

        import java.util.Arrays;

        import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
        import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
        import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
        import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
        import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;

        @SpringBootApplication
        public class Application {

            public static void main(String[] args) {
                SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
            }

            @Bean
            public CommandLineRunner commandLineRunner(ApplicationContext ctx) {
                return args -> {

                    System.out.println("Let's inspect the beans provided by Spring Boot:");

                    String[] beanNames = ctx.getBeanDefinitionNames();
                    Arrays.sort(beanNames);
                    for (String beanName : beanNames) {
                        System.out.println(beanName);
                    }

                };
            }

        }
```


Focus on `@SpringBootApplication` for a moment as it provides significant value.
```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/spring-boot/src/main/java/com/example/springboot/Application.java
text: "@SpringBootApplication"
```

`@SpringBootApplication` is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following from the Spring Core framework:
*   `@Configuration`: Tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.
*   `@EnableAutoConfiguration`: Tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings. For example, if `spring-webmvc` is on the classpath, this annotation flags the application as a web application and activates key behaviors, such as setting up a `DispatcherServlet`.
*   `@ComponentScan`: Tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the `com/example` package, letting it find the controllers.

The `main()` method uses Spring Bootâ€™s `SpringApplication.run()` method to launch an application. 
```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/spring-boot/src/main/java/com/example/springboot/Application.java
text: "main"
```

Did you notice that there was not a single line of XML? There is no `web.xml` file, either. This web application is 100% pure Java and you did not have to deal with configuring any plumbing or infrastructure.

There is also a `CommandLineRunner` method marked as a `@Bean`, and this runs on start up. It retrieves all the beans that were created by your application or that were automatically added by Spring Boot. It sorts them and prints them out.

text: "CommandLineRunner"
```
